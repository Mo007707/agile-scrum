        <h1>WELCOME</h1>
        <h2>ON THIS PAGE YOU LEARN ABOUT AGILE AND SCRUM IN MO'S TERMS, NOT LAYMANS</h2>
    <h3>What is Agile?</h3>
    <p>Agile is a process in which you work towards shorter term goals and getting them done, implementing them into the program allowing the client to use the program even though its not complete</p>
    
    <h3>What is scrum</h3>
    <p>Agile PM framework to develop, deliver and sustain complex products. Scrum - getting work done. Scrum and agile are not the same thing. Scrum is about continuously shipping value to customers. And agile is just a set of value and principles. You cant just go agile, it takes a lot more to change the way you think, however something like agile can help you start thinking in a more agile way and help you building more agile way into communication and work. </p>

    <h3>Why do software teams use scrum</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Requirements change</li>
        <li>Goals change</li>
        <li>Situations change</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Scrum - a little bit more</h3>
      <p>Scrum - work is done in ‘sprints’. Break down big projects into smaller pieces. Project is more manageable, ship high quality work faster and more frequently. More flexibility to adapt and change. Scrums transparency help to overcome problems people come across in the waterfall framework. Short projects help the developers reduce risk and cost, get fast feedback from users , increase speed to market and see the values quicker. As the work is broken down into small sprints, team reaches milestones regularly, gives them sense of regular and tangible progress. Helps them to stay focused and energised, increases satisfaction, motivation.</p>
    
      <h3>What are Sprints in scrum?</h3>
      <p>A sprint is a short, time-boxed period when a scrum team works to complete a set amount of work. Sprints are at the very heart of scrum and agile methodologies and getting sprints right will help your agile team ship better software with fewer headaches.</p>

      <p>Many associate scrum sprints with agile software development, so much so that scrum and agile are often thought to be the same thing. They’re not. Agile is a set of principles and scrum is a framework for getting s#it done.</p>
        
      <p>The many similarities between agile values and scrum processes lead to a fair association. Sprints help teams follow the agile principle of "delivering working software frequently," as well as live the agile value of "responding to change over following a plan." The scrum values of transparency, inspection, and adaptation are complementary to agile and central to the concept of sprints.</p>
